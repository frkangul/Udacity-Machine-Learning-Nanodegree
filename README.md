# Machine-Learning-Nanodegree
This repo includes project codes written for Machine Learning course on Udacity platform. Course materials here are coming from a very early version of Udacity where they used Georgia Tech University materials.

There exist three main projects in this course. The first one is related to regression and it is simply house price prediction (continuous output). The second one is a classification project named CharityML. The last one is about the customer clustering problem in a mall.
